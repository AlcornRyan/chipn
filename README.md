## Description

Chipn is a mobile and desktop web-app that aims to streamline the creation and maintenance of monthly giving programs for charities. It does this by letting charities create profiles and set up ‘donation tiers’ which donors can sign up for as subscriptions. Donors are able to track their donation analytics and connect with charities, which provides them with an easy and transparent giving process. Tax receipts will also be generated and handed out through Chipn’s software. We hope tiers and analytics will help to gamify the giving process, as well as normalize the idea of ‘microtransactions’ in regard to donating.
